# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things to consider:
-All throws per frame are populated at once with each curl request, cannot do one throw at a time;
-There are no players with the same name displayed as usually if 2 or more players have the same name, they will use their last name/only one letter/nickname to differenciate one from the other - easier to read when doing the curl requests instead of using the player id


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 3.2.1
* Rails version 7.0.8

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization
